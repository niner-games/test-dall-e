# Don't Starve

The game “Don’t Starve” has a unique, surreal art style that is hand-drawn and shown from a 2D perspective. However, the way the objects are placed and how you move within the game really make it feel 3D 1. Some people have described it as “Burtonesque” 2. Is there anything else you would like to know about the game?
